# Homework-2-JAVA
This repository contains a JAVA code created for the second homework from ANLY560. This code assigns 5 grade values to corresponding variables and then calculates the average grade from these variables. 
Through multiple if-else-if conditions, we assign a number corresponding to the variable "gradecase" to the possible grade based on the average grade. Through a switch case condition, various appropriate messages are displayed based on the "gradecase" variable.
Finally, the program displayes the average grade, the gradecase number for the grade, followed by a message with the alphabetic grade value.
